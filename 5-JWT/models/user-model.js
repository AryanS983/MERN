/* JWT is a compact, secure token your server gives after login ‚Äî 
and you use it to prove who you are when accessing private stuff.

How JWT Works (Step-by-step)

üîê 1. User Logs In
You verify their email and password.

ü™™ 2. Server Gives a JWT
jwt.sign({ userId: "123", name: "Aryan" }, secretKey)
It creates a token : eyJhbGciOi...<some_long_token>

üß≥ 3. User Stores the Token
Usually in localStorage or cookies

üì¨ 4. User Sends JWT in Requests
Every time the user visits a protected route:

‚úÖ 5. Server Verifies JWT
If the token is valid, the server lets them in. No need to log in again until it expires!


üì¶ What's Inside a JWT?
It has 3 parts, separated by dots:
HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE

Header: says which algorithm is used (e.g., HS256)

Payload: the actual data, like:
{
  "userId": "123",
  "name": "Aryan",
  "role": "user",
  "exp": 1712354870
}
Signature: a secure hash to make sure nobody has tampered with it */
